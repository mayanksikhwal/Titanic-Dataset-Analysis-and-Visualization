# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis-and-Visualization
Project Description:
This project performs exploratory data analysis and visualization on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to understand the characteristics of the passengers, identify patterns, handle missing data, engineer new features, and visualize relationships to gain insights into factors that influenced survival.


# Tech Stack
•	Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
•	pandas: Used for data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
•	NumPy: Used for numerical operations.
•	Matplotlib: Used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
•	Seaborn: Used for creating informative statistical graphics based on Matplotlib.
•	ydata-profiling: Used for generating an interactive HTML report with a detailed analysis of the dataset.
•	Google Colab: The environment where the notebook was developed and executed.
•	Git: Used for cloning the dataset repository.


# How to Run
1.	Clone the dataset repository: You can clone the dataset directly into your Google Colab environment using the following command in a code cell:
________________________________________

!git clone 'https://github.com/GeeksforgeeksDS/21-Days-21-Projects-Dataset'
________________________________________
2. Open and run the notebook:
o	Navigate to the cloned repository in your Colab environment.
o	Open the Titanic-Dataset-Analysis.ipynb notebook file (or the name of your notebook).
o	Run all the cells in the notebook sequentially. This will perform the data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, analysis, and generate visualizations and the profiling report.
________________________________________
3.	View the profiling report:
o	The ydata-profiling report will be displayed directly in the notebook output.
o	An HTML version of the report (titanic_dataset_report.html) will also be saved in your Colab environment, which you can download.

# View Interactive Report:
Download `titanic_dataset_report.html` and open it in your browser to explore visualizations.
